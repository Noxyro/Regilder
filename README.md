This was and is still a WIP that I made some years ago, since the regilding tool at https://theriebel.de/gilding/ seemed to stop working.
Currently all this does, is show a skeleton website layout, which can read the encrypted save game into JSON and read some of the important properties for regilding heroes.
The next 10 upcoming guilds are displayed inside that skeleton view. No data is modified and no actual reguilding is done inside the save game.
No savegame data is currently being exported.

Maybe this can be useful to someone who wants to create their own tool.
