This was and is still a WIP that I made some years ago, since the regilding tool at https://theriebel.de/gilding/ seemed to stop working.
Currently all this does, is show a skeleton website layout, which can read the encrypted save game into JSON and read some of the important properties for regilding heroes.
No actual regilding is done in this version yet and the save game is not exported into encrypted format yet.

But maybe this can be useful to someone who wants to create their own tool.
